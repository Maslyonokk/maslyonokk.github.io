                <p>Hi, I’m Alex, a UX designer from Moldova. </p>
                <p>What made me interested in User Experience is simply using and seeing how different interfaces are designed. I’d notice how one app made me tap through five screens to do something simple and common, confuse me with error messages that disappear before I could realize they are there or interrupt the natural flow I had with them, while another just got it right. Figuring out why some designs are effortless to use, while others feel like an obstacle has drawn me to dig deeper into the field of User Experience Design, and eventually to pursue an education in this field.</p>
                <p>Now I am most excited about projects where I improve a products accessibility, effectiveness and value for the user, and I find myself particularly excelling at user research and user testing.</p> 
                <p>Before UX, my world was game development. That background taught me a lot about things like  interaction design, psychology of experience, and flow states. While games and apps serve different purposes, some fundamentals principles of how they work overlap. This extra perspective helps me in identifying issues, finding creative solutions and testing them.</p>
                <p>I have many hobbies outside of the digital design space. I would say my biggest one is fixing things - bicycles, cars, watches, laptops. I like taking things apart, seeing how they were made, and resolving problems. My ears always perk up when I hear someone complain about something not working right - because often I happen to have what I need to fix it with me.</p>
