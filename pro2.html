                    For this programming exercise I was tasked with designing and making a clock for display at the university’s main hall’s screen. It had to have an interactive element and be made with p5.js.                 </p>



                <p>
                    The inspiration for the design was the origin of the traditional round clock - the sun dials, where the shadows cast by the sun form the hands of the clock. Due to time constraints I had to simplify my concept and ended up with a look that is reminiscent of the themes of sun and moon.                 </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The colors change based on the time of day. The circles arranged around the clock light up to indicate the current second, and remind of the movement of celestial bodies.                </p>


                <p>
                    The challenges I faced while coding this challenge were push and pop functions in p5.js, positioning the hands of the clock exactly right, and finding a way to make the circles falling look natural. After some trial and error where I tried randomizing the speed at which they fall, I figured the most convincing way is to give each circle a random speed to begin with, and keep that consistent.                 </p>

                <p>
                    I liked this challenge because it challenged me both as a designer and a programmer. I’ve gained a new appreciation and understanding for how design and development interrelate and                 </p>
