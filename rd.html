                </h3>
                <p>
                    
                    The assignment was to redesign and improve the clients’ tool for making surveys. The company was experiencing a very high load on their support agents, and was hoping a redesign of the their main tool would help reduce some of that, by making the tool easier and clearer to use.

                </p>


                <h3>
                    Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                    
                    First step was to research the current state of the web tool. For that I have interviewed people that match the client’s customer base as closely as possible, on the topics of online survey creation tools. I also tested the usability and learnability of the current tool of the client together with some competitors, in hopes of identifying areas of improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After analyzing the research data I was able to identify several areas for improvement in the tool and began working on my redesign.  

                </p>
                <p>
                    Mainly I focused on improving the flow of the user experience, rewriting some of the texts to make them clearer and simpler, and putting control elements in more obvious places. I also added a help section and made a design for it.

                    <img src="images/P3_help.png" alt="Newly added Help section">
                </div>
                
                <h3>
                    Results
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I ended up with a hi-fi prototype that was tested to be easier to start using then the original version.
                    The redesigned flow features ways for the user to get explanations for how various options worked, a dedicated Help section with detailed information, as well as improvements to the efficiency of the flow of creating questions, such as easier available buttons and clearer explanations.

                <h3>
                    Key takeaways
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In this project I got to practice the entire design process, from research to prototyping for one project. I also learned how useful it is to know the business goals in a project. Knowing the client wants to reduce the amount of people calling support for help helped me focus my redesign on improving a specific aspect of the tool.
