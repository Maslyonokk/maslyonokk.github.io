                Intro
               </h3>

               <p>
                One of most memorable projects I had the pleasure to work on in university is Shared Spaces. Here we were tasked with designing physical spaces and connected technology for various applications from real clients. Me and my team ended up working on redesigning the bicycle parking solution for train stations. 
               </p>
               <p>
                The challenge was to figure out a way to use space more efficiently, since train stations are running out of space for parking bicycles. We went through the entire design process in this project, by understanding the problem through research and analysis, we ideated prototyped several iterations and presented a final solution. 
               </p>

               <h3>
                Research
               </h3>

               <img src="images/ps1 research.PNG" alt="A snapshot of a summary of research conducted">


               <p>
                In order to deeply understand our challenge after the initial briefing with the client, we had to get hands on and find out as much as we can on location. We used such methods as surveys to see how do people think about using the parking facilities at train stations, observations where we spent time observing how the use and state of bicycle parking at train stations and some others.
               </p>

               <p>
                We managed to identify such issues as _______.                 
               </p>

               <p>
                By creating an affinity diagram we were able to analyze our data efficiently and accurately, and to move forward with a solid understanding
               </p>

               <h3>
                Design
               </h3>

               <p>
                At this stage we presented our research to the client and shared our initial ideas, in order to get their input. Then we chose a direction, based on the clients preference, our timeframe, viability and relevance. 
               </p>

               <p>
                An important part of design process is prototyping and iteration, so that is what our design process mainly revolved around. We modeled our design for the building and prototyped specific interactions to make sure it works as intended and solves the issue of making it easy for people to park their bicycles. 
               </p>

               <h3>
                Prototype and Showcase
               </h3>

               <p>
                For the final presentation of our concept to the client I created a 3D model of our design in Unity, and animated the main interactions. This allowed us to be flexible with last minutes changes, highlight the most important parts of our design as well as explain the general concept and show it in action.
