                    What is this
               </h3>

               <p>
                    A project about designing software for real-time simulation of urban data points for city servants of Delft. 
                    <!-- After a desk research sprint, we created a concept and made a Hi-Fi prototype in Figma over 3 3-week sprints.  -->
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Goal
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To create a Hi-Fi prototype of a digital twin interface, which would be used for planning, analysis, simulations at the city hall.
                </p>

               <h3>
                My Role
               </h3>

               <ul>
                    <li>Designed the UI of data shown directly on the map</li>
                    <li>Made the flow for for working with map data</li>
                    <li>Designed the tutorial screens</li>
                    <li>Created Hi-Fi flows in Figma for the above</li>
                    <li>Connected the flows of the rest of the team into one whole</li>
               </ul>

               </div>

               <h3>Process</h3>
               <p>
                After our initial sprint, I designed the map's data visualization, drawing inspiration from implementations I found in my personal research. I refined it based on team feedback and added features like map dragging for increased immersion. In later sprints, I was mainly connecting flows in Figma and implemented zoom functionality and complete flows for tutorials and data selection.

                <h3>
                    Results
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the end we created an extensive Figma prototype for a software aimed at both proficient and newer users. The final design includes features for working with data, collaboration, sharing data and work, an introduction to the software, logging in and settings.                 </p>
                
                <h3>What I learned</h3>

                <p>
                    The main takeaways from this experience were a deepened understanding of Figma and of importance of staying organised when working in a team. I would go as far as to say I have hit the ceiling of Figma's posibilities (as of end of 2023) for creating this prototype.
